# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Geolocational-Data

This project involves the use of K-Means Clustering to find the best accommodation area for students in Bangalore by classifying accommodation for incoming students on the basis of their preferences on amenities and budget to the location.

In the fast-moving, effort-intense environment that the average person inhabits, it’s a frequent occurrence that one is too tired to fix oneself a home-cooked meal. And of course, even if one gets home-cooked meals every day, it is not unusual to want to go out for a good meal every once in a while for social/recreational purposes. Either way, it’s a commonly understood idea that regardless of where one lives, the food one eats is an important aspect of the lifestyle one leads.

Imagine a scenario where a person has newly moved into a new location. They already have certain preferences, certain tastes. It would save both the student and the food providers a lot of hassle if the student lived close to their preferred outlets. Convenience means better sales, and saved time for the customer.
